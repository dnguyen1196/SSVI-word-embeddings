# Make sure that synthetic data works
- create a main program with synthetic option
- Report after every round instead of every 100 iterations

# Test on word embeddings data


# Look into how to do evaluation
- Built in gensim tools that just needs a text filecontaining the words vectors
- 

# Possibility of simple SSVI algorithm that doesnt update the covariance
but only the mean vectors

# Implement GPU-powered code
- How to use GPU in tensor flow
- Parallelize the computation involving minibatches

# Other details
- Take note of the format of csvfile
- (0,0) might appear together so the code in SSVI might need to change
