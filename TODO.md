# Test on word embeddings data
- Print report on changes in norm of gradient and covariance factor
- Keeps track of the changes in 

# Look into how to do evaluation
- Built in gensim tools that just needs a text filecontaining the words vectors
- 

# Possibility of simple SSVI algorithm that doesnt update the covariance
but only the mean vectors

# Implement GPU-powered code
- How to use GPU in tensor flow
- Parallelize the computation involving minibatches
